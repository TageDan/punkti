# punkti

punkti is a flipdot-display I built. The goal is to create a "puzzle piece" flipdot so that i can press-fit multiple together to create a bigger display. I also want to create my own protocol for controlling the flipdots (probably just bitmaps) and a controller in rust. The checkpoints and current progres are:

* [X] Case (puzzle piece)
* [X] Dot
* [ ] Electromagnet
* [ ] Circuit
* [ ] Controller
* [ ] Protocol
